# Upgradeable Solidity Smart Contract UUPS Standard

## Coded with:
Solidity
Javascript (Web3.js, Hardhat)

An example project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.
